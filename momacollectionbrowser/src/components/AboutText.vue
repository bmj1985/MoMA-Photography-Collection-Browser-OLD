       <p>The Museum of Modern Art has been instrumental in the history of photography,
             and has one of the most extensive photography collections in the world.  
             Although their own website is searchable and even sortable by year, 
             it does not give easily to browsing and discovery.</p>
          <p>
            This site was created in the hopes of making photography and photographers
             in the museum's collection easier to discover.  Currently the browser 
             supports browsing by print type, and shows a random selection each time 
             the radio buttons are clicked. Future implementations will have added 
             searching and browsing capabilities.
